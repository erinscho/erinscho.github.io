<h2>1. Basic Definition:</h2>
<p>Zero-knowledge proofs allow one party (a prover) to prove to another party (a verifier) that they know a certain value of &ldquo;x&rdquo; without  revealing anything about the value &ldquo;x&rdquo;. Zero- knowledge proofs have three properties: completeness (an honest verifier can prove a true statement  made by an honest prover), soundness (an honest verifier cannot be convinced  of a false statement  by a cheating prover), and zero-knowledge  (verifier doesn&rsquo;t need a secret to understand whether the statement  is true).<br>
Zero knowledge  proofs were first invented by Goldwasser, Micali, and Rackoff in 1982. In general,  zero knowledge proofs fall  into two categories: protocol design and identification scheme. A protocol  design is an algorithm for parties to achieve some goal; an example of this is the Diffie-Hellman protocol  that assumes that both parties will follow the algorithm instructions. However,  zero knowledge proofs take this one step further by achieving security even when one of the  parties is &ldquo;cheating&rdquo; and not following instructions. This involves  design- ing  a cryptographic protocol that first assumes everyone will follow the algorithm, and then &ldquo;forces&rdquo; them to follow the instructions using  a zero knowledge system.  Identification schemes are equivalent  to a secret PIN number  or key card used on a box outside a door for entrance.  However, with a traditional PIN or a  keycard, the box can be examined  and extracted for the secret keys. Instead,  using a zero knowledge proof,  we can have the box contain a composite number n= p*q, give authorized people  the solution p, q, and have them prove to the box they know the factorization in zero knowledge.</p>
<h2>2. Easy-to Understand Examples (These will  have pictures/diagrams accompanying them):</h2>
<p>To understand these  complex protocols, let us first consider the &ldquo;color blind  friend&rdquo; proof. Imagine your friend is colour-blind and you have two balls: one that is red and one that is green, but are both otherwise identical. To your friend, they seem completely identical and he is skeptical  that they are actually distinguishable. You want to prove to him they are in fact differently-coloured, but nothing else - thus you do not reveal which one is the red and which is the green.<br>
  Here is the proof system. You give the  two balls to  your friend and he puts them behind his back. Next, he takes one of the balls and brings it out from behind his back and displays it. This ball is then placed behind his back again and then he chooses to reveal just one of the two balls, switching to the other ball with probability 50 percent. He will ask you, &quot;Did I switch the ball?&quot; This whole procedure is then repeated  as often as  necessary.<br>
  By looking at their  colours, you can of course say with  certainty whether  or not he switched them. On the other hand,  if the balls were the same colour and hence indistinguishable, there is an infinitely small change you could guess correctly  with probability higher than 50 percent.<br>
If you and your friend repeat this process multiple times,  your friend should become convinced (&quot;completeness&quot;) that the balls are indeed  differently coloured; otherwise, the prob- ability that you would have randomly succeeded at identifying all the switch/non-switches is close to zero (&quot;soundness&quot;). The above proof is  &ldquo;zero-knowledge&rdquo; because your friend never learns which ball is green and which is red; indeed,  he gains no knowledge  about how to distinguish the balls.</p>
<h2>3. Explanation of the Code:</h2>
<p>We programmed the Feige-Fiat  Shamir Authentication Protocol  and the Discrete Loga- rithm Protocol, two common forms  of zero knowledge proofs.  Typically, in cryptography and the programs created, Peggy represents the prover and Victor represents the verifier.  Peggy is trying to prove that she knows her password:  s (where s is the smallest square root of the multiplicative inverse of v (modulo  n)), where v is a quadratic  residue modulo n.</p>

<h2>4. Real World Applications:</h2>
<p>One real world application of Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are to confirm the authen- ticity of nuclear weapons without sharing any secret design information. Although ZKPs are mainly used in cryptography, due to recent arms control agreements, a trusted  mechanism to verify the authenticity of items  presented as nuclear  warheads has been developed  using ZKPs.<br>
  Zero knowledge  proofs are also used in Blockchains via the zero knowledge  protocol in zkSnarks. SNARK stands for succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge. </p>
<p> <strong><em>Succinct:</em></strong> the messages sent are small in comparison to the calculations.<br>

  <em><strong>Non-interactive</strong></em>: there is little  to no interaction, meaning anyone can verify without  acting anew.<br>
  <em><strong>ARguments:</strong></em> The verifier is protected against computationally limited provers (Sound- ness).<br>
  <em><strong>Knowledge:</strong></em> It is impossible for the prover to construct  a proof without knowing a witness (ex: the hash).<br>
</p>
<p>Through  this protocol, the identity and amount being spent can be hidden and assets can be transferred across a distributed blockchain network with secrecy.<br>
  </p>
<p>Finally, ZKPs are also used in authentication systems.  Often, many secure systems are made from unreliable devices  such as public kiosks that could be compromised. These com- promises include  (but are not limited to) hardware  keylogging, software keylogging, cameras, or even human intervention. There are numerous ways to monitor devices and there is no concrete method to prevent them all. The only reliable  method is to log in through  systems while not passing any sensitive information through the untrusted  device. Currently, the most prominent ZKP system used for authentication  is the Socialist Millionaires Problem  (SMP Protocol).</p>
