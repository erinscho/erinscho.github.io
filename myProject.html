<h2><img width="44" height="61" src="img/clip_image002_0000.gif"><strong><u>Purpose  of Project:</u></strong></h2>
<p>As newer medical  research leaps forward into headlines and grabs  global attention, we often  forget to look after those less fortunate than us.  In particular, the elderly  and especially those who  suffer from dementia such as  Alzheimer&rsquo;s are often left to fend for themselves. There are  an estimated 5.3 million citizens of the US who are 65 years or  older and suffer from Alzheimer&rsquo;s. Even  in Georgia alone, there are around  140,000 elderly citizens  who suffer from this dementia, and  the numbers are expected to continue rising.</p>
<p>Our goal is to use musical performance to help those with  dementia and other mental illnesses, raise awareness to combat mental illness with music, and encourage  non-FBLA members to participate in the community project and become part of the FBLA community.  There has been extensive research done that suggests that by listening to music, specifically famous classical pieces,  dementia patients can slow down the progression of their diseases. Even if a  patient does not suffer from dementia, the effect of music on patients inside places such as  maternity wards is beneficial for the patients. Music is  widely accepted to have a soothing effect  on people and the atmosphere that a live musical performance can create is highly beneficial for places  such as hospitals. The Alpharetta High School FBLA Chapter worked  together to contact various organizations such as hospitals and retirement homes so that the  chapter could organize  events at these locations.  The members of the AHS  FBLA and the musicians  of AHS FBLA worked together to create a calendar so that they  could sign up for these events.</p>

<p>Creating  objectives based off the goals of  FBLA-PBL allowed the team to more closely  operate within  the organization&rsquo;s guidelines  and more actively involve the Alpharetta High School FBLA community. It also  successfully fulfilled the goal of reaching out to non-FBLA members to join FBLA by informing them of  the FBLA goals that  promote scholarship and unity in the  student body.</p>
<h2><img width="44" height="60" src="img/clip_image002_0001.gif"><u>Development:</u></h2>
<p>According to American Law,  there is no requirement for children to care for their aging  elderly parents. Without anything compelling children  to care for their parents, many of the elderly are left  neglected without any proper treatment.  This neglect leads to many elderly that suffer from dementia to not have any access  to facilities that would make dealing with their  disease easier.</p>
<p>The Healing  Music Community was  created to organize talented musicians who want to give back  to the community. Even  within the Georgia area alone,  there are multiple places that give volunteers  an opportunity to perform  for the elderly and  those in hospital wards. </p>
<h2><img width="44" height="60" src="img/clip_image002_0002.gif">    <strong> <u>Establishing Committees:</u></strong>
</h2>
<p>The Healing Music  Project created 3 separate  positions as to make the procedures  run as smoothly  as possible: Communication,  Public Outreach, and  Research.</p>
<p><strong>Derek  Wang </strong>headed the Communication  committee and helped to contact  local organizations such as  hospitals and retirement homes to schedule possible times for musical performances. These  events helped to narrow down  specific opportunities in which FBLA  musicians could play for patients at local establishments.<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Richard  Cho </strong>headed the Public  Outreach committee and helped to organize musicians into time  slots that were organized by the Communication  committee. By giving the FBLA musicians  directions and instructions on which events  they should take part in, the Public Outreach committee allows  there to be higher participation and better quality of performances.</p>
<p><strong>Jason  Juang </strong>headed the Research committee and helped  to do extensive research on the topic  of how music affected patients in hospitals. This research  helped to develop the back bone of the  project and give  validity in how musical performance  has a positive effect on patients  in retirement  homes and hospitals.</p>
<h2><img width="44" height="60" src="img/clip_image002_0003.gif"><u>Implementation:</u> </h2>
<p><strong>Business Outreach </strong>(11/30/2017) </p>
<p>In order to reach out to the local community,  the Public Outreach and  Communications Committee contacted various business around the area. These included Addington Place Senior Home,  Ashwood Meadows Gracious Retirement Living, Ivey Hall Assisted Living, Sunrise at Ivey Ridge, and  William Pu Music Academy.<br>
  The contact  with these retirement homes ensured set dates for the members of the project  to act in advance by creating  an online signup sheet  with set,  informed dates for any FBLA member to  sign up and play for a senior  home. Having set dates strengthen members&rsquo; connection to the community by having  set plans for achieving  the project goal  of combatting  mental illness with music performance. Through this set agenda,  the businesses helped our team spread  awareness of the easy opportunities  accessible to Alpharetta High School  students to give to the community, which helped more FBLA  members get involved in Project Healing Music.</p>
<p><strong>Awareness </strong>(12/9/2017) </p>
<p>In order to gauge the interest of Project Healing Music a meeting was  held in the Alpharetta High  School Orchestra room. Multiple FBLA members attended  as the committee discussed  the mission statement and implementation  of the project. A calendar was  shown in the dates that groups or soloists could perform in nursing homes or hospitals. In  the meeting it discussed that people willing to perform at  Northside hospital&rsquo;s Healing  Sounds program had to send an audition  tape to verify the soloist&rsquo;s  or group&rsquo;s  skill.<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Schoolwide Awareness Week </strong>(12/4/2017-12/8/2017) </p>
<p>During lunch  and after school for a week, the Project Healing Music  team actively spoke to the  fine arts students of Alpharetta High School (non FBLA members included). These students were informed of the scheduled dates and opportunities available to them, and  also encouraged to set their own  dates to play for hospitals,  retirement homes, and anywhere  else that wasconvenient for them. In addition, the students were informed  of the research done on the healing  effect of music on mental illnesses  (most applicable to dementia). This achieved the goal of  spreading awareness  on the effectiveness of combating mental  illness with music. The students were encouraged to act on their own behalf of supporting the community,  even if it was not through  Project Healing Music.<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Government</strong><strong> Awareness </strong>(12/10/2017-12/11/2017) </p>
<p>Project Healing Music had yet  to reach a broad audience, so our team wrote letters to government  officials explaining project Healing Music&rsquo;s purpose to raise awareness for the need for music in the lives of the elderly and the  sick. We targeted the state and local government officials,  specifically writing to Mayor  David Belle Isle of Alpharetta, Mayor Kasim Reed of Atlanta,  and Governor Nathan Deal of Georgia.  We expressed our need  to spread  awareness, and wrote  to encourage our state officials  to persuade other teenage musicians in the area to play music whenever and wherever  they  can.</p>
<h3>Performances </h3>
<p><strong>Performance </strong><strong>at</strong><strong> Northside Hospital </strong>(12/12/2017) </p>
<p>This was AHS FBLA&rsquo;s first  step in giving back to  the community. Richard Cho, project manager, played violin for the Northside  Hospital Women&rsquo;s Center Atrium  in Atlanta. Derek Wang and Jason Juang  interviewed patients  and staff that were part of  the audience while Richard  was playing. From this experience, our team was left with a better understanding of  the impactfulness of music on  the mind, and was motivated  to keep pushing to spread  more awareness and encourage other young musicians  to do the same.</p>

<h4>Interview  with Northside Hospital (12/13/2017) </h4>
<p>As a result  of playing for the Northside Hospital  Women&rsquo;s Center community, the hospital management team sent an email  for an interview for a promotional video they were  creating from yesterday&rsquo;s performance. In gratitude,  our team gladly accepted  and our team email was given  to the Alpharetta local newspaper as well. Some of the questions that we were asked were (directed towards our performer  Richard Cho): Why do you  play  for the community? What inspires you  to play?</p>

<p>What is it that you  are thinking about when you  play? This interview was  later posted with the promotional video of our Public  Outreach playing at Northside Hospital on the Northside Hospital Facebook page, garnering over 1000  views. Ultimately, we were grateful for this opportunity which raised awareness to  encourage other young musicians to play at the hospital as well.</p>
<p><strong>Antebellum</strong><strong> </strong><strong>James</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Burgess</strong><strong> </strong>(12/21/2017) The Antebellum  James Burgess establishment was the  newest senior living home in the Suwanee  area. The senior<br>
living home was  created for veterans after war. A quartet of AHS  FBLA  musicians went to the establishment and performed  for 2 hours.  They played  soothing music for their audience  of veterans to give a break  on their minds, many of whom  were diagnosed with unfortunate cases of TBI(Traumatic  Brain Injury) and  PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder).</p>

<h4>Holiday Season  Performance Event (12/21/2017-12/25/2017) </h4>

With the arrival of winter break, many FBLA- Alpharetta High School Orchestra members were encouraged  to participate in the  Holiday Season Performance  Event. Without the stress of 
homework and  tests and in the season of  giving to the community, many students were willing to play for  the community and as a result, this event was one of the  most successful events yet.
<p><img width="353" height="161" src="img/clip_image002_0003.jpg"></p>
<p>Ashwood Meadows  Gracious Retirement Living</p>
<p><br>
  The Holiday  Season Performance Event took place for four days immediately after  the beginning of winter break. For these four days, musicians  were organized to play at various senior homes: Ashwood Meadows Gracious Retirement Living in Johns  Creek, Belmont Village in Atlanta, Ivy Hall Assisted Living in Alpharetta,  Addington Place in Johns Creek, and  Sunrise Senior Living in Atlanta.<br>
</p>
<p>Performing most often  as  quartets, but also as trios, duos, and solo, the musicians averaged  two hours at each senior living home. Based off research  that classical, gentle music  is most calming to the  mind, our groups performed  calming familiar folk tunes and classical melodies for the senior citizens.<br>
  This event also inspired non-FBLA members to participate with their friends and  family and as a way of just playing  for the enjoyment of others. It inspired  many of these non-FBLA  members to become involved with FBLA hosted events and give an  interest in joining the Future Business Leaders  community in following years. It  showed these non-members that FBLA is  just a composed of competitive business  events – it  is a community that gives  back to the community and its members.</p>

<p>Addington Place</p>
<p><strong>Family</strong><strong> Service Day </strong>(1/20/2018) <br>
  In order to encourage not only the community to contribute the goals of Project Healing Music, but family members  as well, the Project Healing Music  team looked for opportunities to involve family members  as  well. The team organized  an event at a retirement home Sunrise at Ivey Ridge and  encouraged orchestra-FBLA  members to get involved with  their family. In particular,  Outreach Committee Manager Richard Cho brought his entire  family (his two sisters  playing music as well) to play for the Ivey Ridge Residents, many of whom were  victim to unfortunate diseases such as Alzheimer's and arthritis. Playing for these  seniors right after lunch, they were given a  special relaxing  dessert and a moment away from the physical  and mental pains that come  with old age.</p>

<p>Of the multiple members participating during the program,  the following select members earned  a number of hours and  deserve recognition for their  dedication in serving their community with their musical talent.</p>
<p>  The average  time volunteered for each student  involved in Project Healing Music  was 10.2 hours. Some notable  members of the program  include:<br>
  </p>
<p>Junior Rohit Das played piano  at two locations: Piano Works  and Brandywine elementary school. In  total, Mr. Das played a total of  3 solo hours at these two  locations and helped to foster a more positive environment. His performance at Brandywine elementary school  in particular was described as  being a wonderful performance that entertained the audience very much. A quartet consisting of students Adam  Wang, Eileen Liu, Kaci Xie, and Serena Gao played a total  of 26 hours. They played at  multiple locations consisting of multiple retirement homes and schools. All of their performances  have received positive feedback  and their dedication to serving their community is obvious in the number of hours they committed  to their performances.</p>
<p><img width="227" height="228" src="img/clip_image002_0006.jpg"></p>
<p>Members of a Quintet</p>
<p>Junior Richard Cho played violin at multiple locations  which add up to a total of 10 hours  of performances  during the program. Mr. Cho played multiple  times at Northside Hospital  who enjoyed his performances  so much that he was continually invited back to keep  playing. Mr. Cho also  played at retirement homes in the area and the employees of these locations all agreed,  when  interviewed, that Mr. Cho&rsquo;s playing  had a very positive effect on the residents.</p>
<p>  Other than  the talented musicians of FBLA, multiple other members of AHS FBLA committed time and  effort in the coordination and creation  of the project calendar where the  events were held. The outreach to  multiple organizations from the  members allowed the promotion  of awareness for music therapy and gave  members an opportunity to service the community by practicing business  communication.</p>

<h2><img width="44" height="62" src="img/clip_image002_0006.gif"><u>Appendix  A:</u></h2>
<p>In an interview  with Carol Kratochvil from Northside Hospital, an anonymous visitor of Northside,  and a volunteer musician, our team  interviewed them in order to gain a  better understanding of the  impacts and benefits that music therapy had on the hospital and its patients.<br>
Transcript:</p>
<p><br>
<em><strong>Q: How do you think the music that is played impacts the patients?</strong></em><strong></strong></p>
<p>  Kratochvil: Unfortunately, not all  patients are able to hear  the music due to them being in closed rooms for  privacy and peace of mind.  However, sometimes you will see  the moms wheel out  to hear the music because  up here is labor and delivery. It  is relaxing, its entertaining… we have two big concerts  a year with Beethoven  Chamber Orchestra… and as people walk in, sometimes doctors,  they&rsquo;ll stop and listen and they are  always complimentary.<br>
  Visitor: The atmosphere  of the hospital is very stressful no matter where you  are  and the fact that music  is played here or  just in any work place makes it a more soothing  environment.<br>
  Player (Volunteer): From my experience with playing in hospitals  and senior homes, I believe that there  is no substitute to the power  of music on the human mind. Although I cannot say why, music  has an effect on the mentally and physically ill that no physician can replicate with their tools. It is extraordinary that music has such an  impact effect on people. I will  continue to do this as long  as I can and I am honored  to do it through the FBLA  community.<br>
</p>
<p><em><strong>Q: What do you think the benefits music has on mental and physical health?</strong></em></p>
<p>  Kratochvil: There&rsquo;s been lots of research. It lowers blood pressure …doctors encourage patients with high blood pressure  to listen to classical music because it brings  it down. We&rsquo;ve got  music on the bridge of  the walkway, in the main lobby, and  obviously, here.<br>
Visitor: I know  for me, because I listen to music when I work  it creates a soothing environment that I can  work efficiently in. After working, I am always stressed and I find  that music above anything else  is a  big de-stressor for me.</p>
<p>  Player (Volunteer): I have always heard that music has a calming and  destressing nature on health, but to me personally, music makes  me happy and I think it makes  the people around me as well.  Even playing sad music,  it is not necessarily depressing or in pain, but lifts the mood and takes the mind off physical and  mental health issues that one may have. It  is almost  like a painkiller for mental health; it is a moment of bliss in which one can be themselves without having to worry about  the mental pains affecting  them.
